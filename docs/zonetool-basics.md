## x64-zt
x64-zt is a tool for reading/writing assets from & into newer Call of Duty games. You can find the tool at the [official x64-zt GitHub repository](https://github.com/Joelrau/x64-zt).

As far as x64-zt goes, this tool is mainly for newer Call of Duty games. Anything listed in the conversion support table below is what is supported. For map porting and for older Call of Duty porting, check out [Map Porting IW3/4/5](#map-porting-iw345---h1h2s1). For porting to something like AW -> MWR, check out [Map Porting S1](#map-porting-s1---h1).

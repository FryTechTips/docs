# How to install H1-Mod

## Installing base game files

:::warning

Torrenting copyright protected files might not be legal in your country even if you already own a valid license! We (The H1-Mod Staff and Members) are not responsible for any legal issues, and we highly recommend you to use a fresh install from Steam or the usage of a VPN.

:::

1. Download/Open your torrent client, we recommend using the [qBittorrent Windows Client](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html) (**ADD IMAGE HERE FOR CORRECT DOWNLOAD SECTION**)

2. Download and open the torrent file [h1_full_game.torrent] (**ADD LINK HERE**)

3. Once it is open, there will be a dialogue box, where you will be able to specify the saving location. We highly recommend making a separate "Games" folder in order to do this (for example C:\Games) (**ADD IMAGE HERE**)

## "I already have the Steam version" / "I don't have the DLC"

    If you already have the steam version, you may install the DLCs using our DLC torrent.

1. Download the DLC torrent [h1_dlc.torrent] (**ADD LINK TO TORENT**)

2. Extract and place all the DLC files in the root directory of your game. If the dialogue box asks you to merge folders, click "yes to all" (**ADD IMAGE HERE**)

## Installing the H1-Mod client

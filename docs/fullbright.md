# FullBright

- Fullbright makes a comeback in H1-Mod and we have multiple options for users to pick, using the 'r_fullbright' command.

1. r_fullbright 0 disables fullbright. All lights are rendered.
2. r_fullbright 1 cranks all the lights to 10, making visibility very easy, but also very ugly.
3. r_fullbright 2 will disable lighting on the viewmodel and will make every other light the same as r_fullbright 1.
4. r_fullbright 3 disables all dynamic lighting. Game visuals are mainly unaffected, and this can help with performance on some low-end builds.
5. r_fullbright 4 is the developer feature for lightmaps, and is not intended for player usage. Red dot crosshairs will not work in this mode, but it will look cool (siezure warning for users of r_fullbright 4. That is our disclaimer).

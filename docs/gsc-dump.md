# Stock GSC dump

The [H1 GSC dump](https://github.com/mjkzy/h1-gsc-dump) is a dump of the game's GSC scripts. Because H1 is based off IW6 (Ghosts), the GSC remains the same in many areas while being different in other areas. For that reason, you can use the IW6 GSC dump <i>(see Resources below)</i> that contains developer comments and names for functions, variables, etc. For the most part, we have labelled everything in the H1 gsc dump by comparing it to S1 (Advanced Warfare) GSC scripts to make it easier to investigate.

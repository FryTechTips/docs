# Aim-Assist


-COD:MWR already has native controller support for both Xbox (Xinput) and PS4 Controllers. 

-Aim-Assist is natively on by default once you plug in a controller. 

-The only popular controller that does not fall in this category is the PlayStation 5 controller. You will need to use a tool called DS4Windows in order to get the game to recognize it (layout for that will be the PS4 controller).

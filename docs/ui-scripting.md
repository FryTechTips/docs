# LUI scripting

At the moment, there is no general documentation from UI Scripting. UI Scripting is also Lua-based and is referred to as "LUI" (Lua UI). The game uses Havok LUA for their UI stuff, so it is very easy to work with UI Scripting and to modify the game's UI. For references to see how we do our current UI Scripting patches and unique features, you can check our GitHub repo's [data folder](https://github.com/auroramod/h1-mod/tree/develop/data/cdata/ui_scripts) that is shipped out with the client.

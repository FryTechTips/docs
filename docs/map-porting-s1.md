# Map Porting (S1 -> H1 <- H2)

To port maps from S1 or H2, you must use [x64-zt](https://github.com/Joelrau/x64-zt). You can also download the [S1 Asset Listing from here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1032511834420420640/1196505669440909372/s1_asset_listing.zip?ex=67080e3d&is=6706bcbd&hm=680cfcc7511fe2ddb124439c0b9f4ee2c58e6769e1c609f9fde69abb08c82c8a&)

Once you find the zone you want to dump *(example: mp_greenband from S1)*, use the `dumpmap <target game> <zone>` command and wait for your zone to dump. 
1. Run the command at `dumpmap h1 mp_greenband`
2. Find the finalized dumped zone folder at `%S1 game files%/dump/mp_greenband/`
3. Move the dumped folder to `%MWR game files%/zonetool/mp_greenband/`
4. Open x64-zt, and run the command `generatecsv <zone>` *(example: `generatecsv mp_greenband`)*

After you've generated your CSV, your map can now be built. Simply run `buildzone mp_greenband` to build the map.

### Extra steps
For the map to look correct, you must create a GSC file for your map. This will be a script that will be executed once the map starts. This script differs on multiplayer & singleplayer. Dumping a map from S1 or H2 should have a map GSC you can use or reference to make a new one.

Multiplayer:
```cpp
main()
{
    maps\createfx\mapname_fx::main();
    maps\mp\mapname_fx::main();
    maps\mp\_load::main();
    maps\mp\_compass::setupminimap("compass_map_mapname");  // change compass name here
}
```

Singleplayer:
```cpp
main()
{
    maps\createfx\mapname_fx::main(); // only if this script exists
    maps\mapname_fx::main(); // only if this script exists
    maps\_load::main();
    maps\_compass::setupminimap("compass_map_mapname"); // change compass name here
}
```

### Red images
Red images indicates that you are missing images. Dump the source game's common fastfile *(most of the time it is called `common_mp` for multiplayer and `common` for singleplayer)* using the command:
```
dumpzone <target game> common_mp
```

Note that a "patch" version of the common fastfile always exists (example: `patch_common_mp`), so the assets could also be there.

You should then move this folder from `dump/` into a folder called `zonetool_paths` in your target game's root directory. x64-zt will look for assets in any folder inside zonetool_paths. Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the dumped folder into the map's zonetool folder, but this is not advised as it will take a long time.

### "REF" red models
The process to fix is relatively the same with images.

### Textures are black/gray/white/red
This probably means that zonetool failed to dump the streamed images. To check if this is the case, see if the `streamed_images` folder contains .pixels files, if not then something went wrong. Most likely zonetool was unable to find the source game's image files. This should not happen.

### Vertex type X doesn't have the information used by shader Y in material Z
This most likely indicates you are missing that particular material, the same fix as issue #1 should apply.

### Bad weaponinfo X specified for turret. It likely needs to be precached in script.
This indicates that the original map includes a turret, you can either:

Simply remove the turret entirely (this is advised unless you really want the turret). To do this, open the `<mapname>.d3dbsp.ents` file you will find in `zonetool/mapname/maps/mp` or `zonetool/mapname/maps/` and search for `"weaponinfo"`. Once found, remove the entire section that includes it, example:
```json
{
"bottomarc" "70"
"rightarc" "40"
"leftarc" "40"
"targetname" "minigun_turret_2"
"spawnflags" "0"
"toparc" "10"
"classname" "misc_turret"
"export" "1"
"model" "npc_minigun_turret"
"weaponinfo" "turret_minigun_mp"
"origin" "1004.5 -80 865"
"angles" "0 180 0"
}
```

Everything from and including the opening bracket to the closing bracket should be removed. Repeat this for every case of "weaponinfo" in the file.

**Or** you can add the required assets (usually just the weapon): Repeat the same process as for removing it but don't actually remove it and simply save every instance of the value of `"weaponinfo"`.

For example, the value of one of the weaponinfo's is `turret_minigun_mp`. This just gets parsed in your CSV as:
```
weapon,turret_minigun_mp
```

### animation 'X' not defined in anim tree '{animtree name}'
This means the map is using an animation tree that is not defined on the target game. Dump the `{animtree name}.atr` of the source game, which is usually found in the common fastfile *(refer to issue #1)*, copy the file (including its folder: `animtrees/{animtree name}.atr`) into a folder called **override** (create it if it doesn't exist) inside `[target game]/zonetool/mapname/`, then include it in the csv (refer to issue #1).

```
rawfile,override/animtrees/{animtree name}.atr
```
